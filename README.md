# Roll Call 📋  
_A QR Code Based Attendance System for Achievers University_

## 📖 Overview
Roll Call is a simple web app that helps manage student attendance using **QR codes**.  
- **Students** generate their unique QR codes with their matric number and name.  
- **Lecturers** scan these QR codes to mark attendance during class.  

The project is built with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and uses free, open-source libraries via CDN.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎓 **Student QR Generator**: Each student generates a QR code tied to their matric number + name.  
- 👨‍🏫 **Lecturer QR Scanner**: Lecturers scan student codes directly from their browser using the device camera.  
- 🔗 **One Deployment**: Both student and lecturer pages are hosted together, with a landing page for easy navigation.  
- 🌐 **Lightweight & Free**: No backend, no premium frameworks — just front-end code and free libraries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **QR Code Generator**: [`qrcode.js`](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode) via CDN  
- **QR Code Scanner**: [`html5-qrcode`](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode) via CDN  
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the [Roll Call app](https://roll-call-three.vercel.app/).  
2. On the landing page:  
   - Click **"I am a Student"** → go to Student page.  
   - Click **"I am a Lecturer"** → go to Lecturer page.  
3. **Students**: Enter your matric number + name → generate your unique QR code.  
4. **Lecturers**: Use the camera scanner to read student QR codes → attendance is logged in real-time.

## 🎯 Future Improvements
- 🔒 Add a backend (Node.js, Firebase, etc.) to store attendance logs.  
- 📊 Generate attendance reports (download as CSV/Excel).  
- 📱 Mobile optimization for smoother use on phones.  
- 🎨 Improve UI/UX for even cleaner presentation.

Backup QR Attendance System – Project Briefing
Project Overview

The Backup QR Attendance System is designed as a high-integrity, independent attendance mechanism for educational institutions. Its purpose is to provide a reliable fallback when the primary facial recognition attendance system fails, while maintaining security, preventing impersonation, and ensuring proper logging of all attendance events.

This system is independent of facial recognition and can be used in parallel or as a standalone attendance mechanism.

Key Features

One-Time, Session-Locked QR Codes

Each student QR is valid only for a specific class session.

Tokens expire in a short timeframe (e.g., 20–30 seconds) to prevent sharing.

QR includes cryptographic signatures to prevent forgery.

Student Verification

Each QR is tied to a unique student ID.

QR codes are generated by the backend, using a secret token per student, ensuring mathematical unforgeability.

Session Management

Each class/session has a unique sessionId.

Lecturer manually inputs session details (course, time, etc.) before class.

QR validity is bound to session duration and class timing.

Secure Backend Verification

Backend verifies:

Student existence

Session validity

QR token signature

QR expiry

Token reuse (one-time usage)

Only valid QR codes are accepted; all invalid or expired codes are rejected.

Retry & Grace Mechanism

Students can retry scans if initial scan fails.

Small grace period allowed for late or accidental scans.

All failed attempts are logged for transparency.

Manual Override

Admins or lecturers can manually mark attendance for students who experience genuine issues (e.g., device malfunction, network failure).

Every override is logged to maintain auditability.

Independent Operation

System does not rely on facial recognition to function.

Can be deployed as a standalone attendance system or as a backup for primary systems.

Database Structure

Collections/Tables:

students

studentId (unique)

matricNumber

fullName

department

level

secretToken (private)

sessions

sessionId (unique)

course

lecturerId

startTime

endTime

qrTokens

token (one-time, random)

studentId

sessionId

expiresAt (timestamp)

used (boolean)

createdAt (timestamp)

attendance

studentId

sessionId

scanTime

status (on-time, late, absent)

scanMethod (QR, manual override)

notes (e.g., failed scan reason)

Flow of Operations

Session Creation

Lecturer inputs session details manually.

Session is stored in database with unique sessionId.

QR Generation

Student requests QR code via the frontend.

Backend generates one-time signed token using:

Student ID

Session ID

Random nonce

Secret token

QR code includes session-bound token and expiry timestamp.

QR Scanning

Scanner decodes QR and sends data to backend.

Backend validates token, student, session, expiry, and one-time usage.

If valid, attendance is logged; if invalid, scan is rejected.

Retry and grace periods are allowed for genuine scan errors.

Manual Override

Admin/lecturer can manually mark attendance if QR scanning fails due to genuine issues.

All overrides are logged for audit.

Security Advantages

One-Time Tokens: Prevents sharing, replay attacks, and reuse.

Cryptographically Signed Tokens: Cannot be forged even if matric numbers are known.

Short Expiry + Session Lock: Ensures QR is valid only for the correct time and session.

Fallback System: Functions independently of facial recognition while remaining secure.
